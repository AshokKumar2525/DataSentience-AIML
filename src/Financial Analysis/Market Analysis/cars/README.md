# 🚗 Car Performance Classifier

This project aims to classify cars into performance categories — **Sport**, **Standard**, or **Eco** — based on numerical performance metrics like **HorsePower**, **Top Speed**, and **0–100 km/h Acceleration Time**. The project uses **unsupervised clustering (KMeans)** to group cars into performance tiers, followed by **cluster-to-label mapping** based on cluster centroids.

## 🎯 Objective

- Identify whether a car is:
  - **Sport**: High horsepower, fast acceleration
  - **Eco**: Low horsepower, slow acceleration, high efficiency
  - **Standard**: Moderate all-round performance
